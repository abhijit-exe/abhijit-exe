# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhijit Kshirsagar

I'm a final-year undergraduate student pursuing Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering with an Honors in Deep Learning. I’m currently exploring AI/ML, NLP, and Computer Vision through internships, online certifications, and hands-on projects.

This GitHub is a collection of the projects I've worked on—some course-related, some self-initiated—where I try to apply what I’m learning to solve real-world problems in a simple and understandable way.

## 📌 Some Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🧠 T5 Text Summarizer
Used Hugging Face’s `T5ForConditionalGeneration` to create a text summarizer with three modes: brief, medium, and detailed. Useful for summarizing articles, transcripts, or any general text.

### 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition
Built a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras to classify Indian and German traffic signs. Learned about data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation through this.

### 😴 Sleep Stage Classification
Implemented a CNN-LSTM model trained on PSG and hypnogram data to classify sleep stages. This helped me understand multi-signal data handling and time-series learning.

### 📊 Data Analyst Agent with LLaMA
Built an LLM-powered tool that takes input files and answers questions about them using retrieval-augmented generation. Integrated with LLaMA-2 and used RAG basics.
